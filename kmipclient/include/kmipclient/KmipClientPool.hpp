/**
 * Thread-safe pool of KmipClient connections.
 *
 * Each thread borrows a KmipClient for the duration of one or more KMIP
 * operations and then returns it automatically via RAII.  The pool creates
 * new TLS connections on demand, up to max_connections.  When all connections
 * are in use and the limit has been reached, borrow() blocks until one becomes
 * available.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * @code
 *   KmipClientPool pool({
 *       .host = "kmip-server",
 *       .port = "5696",
 *       .client_cert = "/path/to/cert.pem",
 *       .client_key  = "/path/to/key.pem",
 *       .server_ca_cert = "/path/to/ca.pem",
 *       .timeout_ms  = 5000,
 *       .max_connections = 8
 *   });
 *
 *   // In any thread:
 *   auto conn = pool.borrow();
 *   auto id   = conn->op_create_aes_key("mykey", "mygroup");
 *   // conn is returned to the pool automatically when it goes out of scope.
 * @endcode
